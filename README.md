# Camera-Control-Module
Code to use two potentiometers to control camera brightness and contrast on the Raspberry Pi.

The current code allows you to set up a time-lapse capture system with a Rapsberry Pi connected to a MCP3008 digital-to-analog converter chip, a push button and two 10K Ohm Potentiometers.

The Try function can be pulled out and used for other image and video capture tasks. Just modify the script to take a single photo, a video or slow-motion video.

Code is modified from a Maximum PC article on the subject. The article can be found in the August 2017 issue or online.
